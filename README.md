# 🌿 Xero Integration - Full Configuration Guide

Welcome to the graceful dance between your system and Xero — where each token is a step, each API call a breath of automated accounting. This guide will walk you, step by step, through the configuration of **Xero Partner 2.0**, to handle both **incoming and outgoing payments**, with clarity, security, and a touch of poetry.

---

## 🔐 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An active Xero Partner 2.0 account.
- A valid `client_id` and `client_secret`.
- An app registered at [https://developer.xero.com/myapps](https://developer.xero.com/myapps).
- A working Node.js or Python backend for API calls.
- A secure backend (with token handling, logs, and persistence).

---

## 🧩 Configuration Steps

### 1. Xero App Setup

1. Sign in to [Xero Developer](https://developer.xero.com/myapps)
2. Create a new app:
   - **Name**: `Xero NetManagement`
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://your-backend.com/callback`
   - Copy your `client_id` and `client_secret`.

---

### 2. OAuth 2.0 Authentication

Authentication is the golden key. Here’s how to get an `access_token`:

#### Step 1 - Generate Authorization URL:
https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=&redirect_uri=https://your-backend.com/callback&scope=openid profile email accounting.transactions offline_access&state=123


Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your real ID.

#### Step 2 - Exchange code for token:
```bash
curl -X POST https://identity.xero.com/connect/token \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
-d 'code=RECEIVED_CODE' \
-d 'redirect_uri=https://your-backend.com/callback' \
-d 'client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID' \
-d 'client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
This will return:

{
  "access_token": "...",
  "refresh_token": "...",
  "expires_in": 1800
}
3. Connect to Your Xero Tenant

curl -X GET https://api.xero.com/connections \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
Retrieve your tenantId, the secret key to all future requests.

💸 Handling Payments (IN & OUT)

Incoming Payments (IN)

Create invoices using the /invoices endpoint.
Track their status (PAID, AUTHORISED, etc.).
Automate verification through the API.
Outgoing Payments (OUT)

Post payments to suppliers using /payments:
POST https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Payments
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
  xero-tenant-id: TENANT_ID

Body:
{
  "Invoice": {
    "InvoiceID": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  },
  "Account": {
    "AccountID": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  },
  "Date": "2025-04-22",
  "Amount": 200.00
}
🛡 Security & Monitoring

Use Okta to manage sessions and user roles via JWT.
Store access_token and refresh_token securely (use .env or Vault).
Refresh tokens using the refresh_token every 30 minutes:
curl -X POST https://identity.xero.com/connect/tokenGET \
-d 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
-d 'refresh_token=...' \
-d 'client_id=...' \
-d 'client_secret=...'
🔔 Notification System

Set up a cron job to analyze daily logs.
In case of errors, alert via:
Discord (via webhook)
Email
Slack (via bot)
🧪 Test Environment

Before going live:

Use the Xero sandbox environment (via demo tenant).
Test the full flow: invoice creation, status check, payment, token refresh.

# Xero API Integration for Incoming and Outgoing Payments

To ensure that incoming (in) and outgoing (out) payments on Xero are effectively processed, you need to make sure that you have properly configured the Xero API integration and are correctly interacting with Xero's endpoints to record and process these payments.

## Steps to manage incoming and outgoing payments on Xero via the API:

### 1. Set up OAuth2 Authentication with Xero

Before you can interact with payments on Xero, you must authenticate with Xero via OAuth2. This allows you to obtain an access token that grants access to your Xero organization’s data. Ensure that your OAuth2 connection works correctly to obtain the proper permissions.

### 2. Manage Incoming Payments (in)

Incoming payments are typically payments made by customers to settle their invoices. You can create an incoming payment via the API by associating a payment with an existing invoice.

#### Example: Creating an Incoming Payment (e.g., via an invoice)

```python
from xero import Xero
from xero.auth import OAuth2Credentials
from xero.exceptions import XeroException

# Authentication
credentials = OAuth2Credentials(client_id='your_client_id', client_secret='your_client_secret', callback_uri='your_callback_uri')
xero = Xero(credentials)

# Incoming payment details
payment = {
    'Invoice': {
        'InvoiceID': 'your_invoice_id'  # The ID of the invoice the payment is linked to
    },
    'Amount': 100.0,  # The payment amount
    'Account': {
        'Code': '100'  # The code for the bank account in Xero
    },
    'Date': '2025-04-22',  # Payment date
    'PaymentType': 'RECEIVE',  # Payment type
    'Reference': 'Payment reference',  # Reference
}

try:
    # Create the payment
    payment_response = xero.payments.create(payment)
    print("Payment created successfully:", payment_response)
except XeroException as e:
    print("Error creating payment:", e)
3. Manage Outgoing Payments (out)

Outgoing payments are payments you make to settle your own invoices or other debts. You associate an outgoing payment with an existing invoice.

Example: Creating an Outgoing Payment (e.g., for a supplier invoice)

# Outgoing payment details
payment_out = {
    'Invoice': {
        'InvoiceID': 'your_supplier_invoice_id'  # The ID of the supplier invoice to be paid
    },
    'Amount': 50.0,  # Payment amount
    'Account': {
        'Code': '200'  # The code for the bank account from which the payment is made
    },
    'Date': '2025-04-22',  # Payment date
    'PaymentType': 'PAY',  # Outgoing payment type
    'Reference': 'Outgoing payment reference',  # Reference
}

try:
    # Create the outgoing payment
    payment_out_response = xero.payments.create(payment_out)
    print("Outgoing payment created successfully:", payment_out_response)
except XeroException as e:
    print("Error creating outgoing payment:", e)
4. Check Payment Status

You can retrieve information about existing payments to check the status of incoming and outgoing payments. This allows you to track ongoing or completed payments.

Example: Retrieving Payments

# Retrieve existing payments
try:
    payments = xero.payments.all()
    print("All payments:", payments)
except XeroException as e:
    print("Error retrieving payments:", e)
5. Error Handling and Management

The Xero API may return errors, including validation errors or connection errors. Be sure to handle these errors properly in your code, as shown in the examples above with try-except and the use of XeroException.

Summary

For incoming payments (in): You associate a payment with an existing customer invoice via the Xero API.
For outgoing payments (out): You associate a payment with an existing supplier invoice or another type of debt.
OAuth2 authentication: You need to obtain an access token via OAuth2 to interact with the Xero API.
Error handling: Be sure to handle errors properly to avoid runtime issues.
Don't forget to test with real data once the integration is completed to ensure that payments are correctly recorded and visible in your Xero dashboard.

Authentication

All API requests go through Xero's OAuth 2.0 gateway and require a valid access_token to be set on the client which appends the access_token JWT to the header of each request.

If you are making an API call for the first time:

Send the user to the Xero authorization URL
@app.route("/login")
def login():
    redirect_url = url_for("oauth_callback", _external=True)
    session["state"] = app.config["STATE"]
    try:
        response = xero.authorize(callback_uri=redirect_url, state=session["state"])
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        raise
    return response
The user will authorize your application and be sent to your redirect_uri. This is when and where to check that the returned "state" param matches that which was previously defined. If the "state" params match, calling the oauth library's authorized_response() method will swap the temporary auth code for an access token which you can store and use for subsequent API calls.
@app.route("/callback")
def oauth_callback():
    if request.args.get("state") != session["state"]:
        return "Error, state doesn't match, no token for you."
    try:
        response = xero.authorized_response()
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        raise
    if response is None or response.get("access_token") is None:
        return "Access denied: response=%s" % response
    store_xero_oauth2_token(response)
    return redirect(url_for("index", _external=True))
Call the Xero API like so:
@app.route("/accounting_invoice_read_all")
@xero_token_required
def accounting_invoice_read_all():
    code = get_code_snippet("INVOICES","READ_ALL")

    #[INVOICES:READ_ALL]
    xero_tenant_id = get_xero_tenant_id()
    accounting_api = AccountingApi(api_client)

    try:
        invoices_read = accounting_api.get_invoices(
            xero_tenant_id
        )
    except AccountingBadRequestException as exception:
        output = "Error: " + exception.reason
        json = jsonify(exception.error_data)
    else:
        output = "Total invoices found:  {}.".format(len(invoices_read.invoices)
        )
        json = serialize_model(invoices_read)
    #[/INVOICES:READ_ALL]

    return render_template(
        "output.html", title="Invoices",code=code, output=output, json=json, len = 0, set="accounting", endpoint="invoice", action="read_all"
    )
It is recommended that you store this token set JSON in a datastore in relation to the user who has authenticated the Xero API connection. Each time you want to call the Xero API, you will need to access the previously generated token set, initialize it on the SDK client, and refresh the access_token prior to making API calls.

Token Set

key	value	description
id_token:	"xxx.yyy.zzz"	OpenID Connect token returned if openid profile email scopes accepted
access_token:	"xxx.yyy.zzz"	Bearer token with a 30 minute expiration required for all API calls
expires_in:	1800	Time in seconds till the token expires - 1800s is 30m
refresh_token:	"XXXXXXX"	Alphanumeric string used to obtain a new Token Set w/ a fresh access_token - 60 day expiry
scope:	["email", "profile", "openid", "accounting.transactions", "offline_access"]	The Xero permissions that are embedded in the access_token
Example Token Set JSON:

{
  "id_token": "xxx.yyy.zz",
  "access_token": "xxx.yyy.zzz",
  "expires_in": 1800,
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "refresh_token": "xxxxxxxxx",
  "scope": ["email", "profile", "openid", "accounting.transactions", "offline_access"]
}
Custom Connections

Custom Connections are a Xero premium option used for building M2M integrations to a single organisation. A custom connection uses OAuth 2.0's client_credentials grant which eliminates the step of exchanging the temporary code for a token set.

Because Custom Connections are only valid for a single organisation you don't need to pass the xero-tenant-id as the first parameter to every method, or more specifically for this SDK xeroTenantId can be an empty string.

Because the SDK is generated from the OpenAPI spec the parameter remains. For now you are required to pass an empty string to use this SDK with a Custom Connection.
App Store Subscriptions

If you are implementing subscriptions to participate in Xero's App Store you will need to setup App Store subscriptions endpoints.

When a plan is successfully purchased, the user is redirected back to the URL specified in the setup process. The Xero App Store appends the subscription Id to this URL so you can immediately determine what plan the user has subscribed to through the subscriptions API.

With your app credentials you can create a client via client_credentials grant_type with the marketplace.billing scope. This unique access_token will allow you to query any functions in AppStoreApi. Client Credentials tokens to query app store endpoints will only work for apps that have completed the App Store on-boarding process.

You should use the subscription data to provision user access/permissions to your application.

App Store Subscription Webhooks

In additon to a subscription Id being passed through the URL, when a purchase or an upgrade takes place you will be notified via a webhook. You can then use the subscription Id in the webhook payload to query the AppStore endpoints and determine what plan the user purchased, upgraded, downgraded or cancelled.

Refer to Xero's documenation to learn more about setting up and receiving webhooks.

https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/webhooks/overview/
API Clients

You can access the different API sets and their available methods through the following:

accounting_api = AccountingApi(api_client)
read_accounts = accounting_api.get_accounts(xero_tenant_id)
asset_api = AssetApi(api_client)
read_assets = asset_api.get_assets(xero_tenant_id)
# ... all the API sets follow the same pattern
Helper Methods

Once you have a valid Token Set in your datastore, the next time you want to call the Xero API simply initialize a new client and refresh the token set.

# configure xero-python sdk client
api_client = ApiClient(
    Configuration(
        debug=app.config["DEBUG"],
        oauth2_token=OAuth2Token(
            client_id=app.config["CLIENT_ID"], client_secret=app.config["CLIENT_SECRET"]
        ),
    ),
    pool_threads=1,
)

# configure token persistence and exchange point between app session and xero-python
@api_client.oauth2_token_getter
def obtain_xero_oauth2_token():
    return session.get("token")

@api_client.oauth2_token_saver
def store_xero_oauth2_token(token):
    session["token"] = token
    session.modified = True

# get existing token set
token_set = get_token_set_from_database(user_id); // example function name

# set token set to the api client
store_xero_oauth2_token(token_set)

# refresh token set on the api client
api_client.refresh_oauth2_token()

# call the Xero API
accounting_api = AccountingApi(api_client)
read_accounts = accounting_api.get_accounts(xero_tenant_id)
A full list of the SDK client's methods:

method	description	params	returns
api_client.oauth2_token_saver	A decorator to register a callback function for saving refreshed token while the old token has expired	token_saver: the callback function accepting token argument	token_saver to allow this method be used as decorator
api_client.oauth2_token_getter	A decorator to register a callback function for getting oauth2 token	token_getter: the callback function returning oauth2 token dictionary	token_getter to allow this method be used as decorator
api_client.revoke_oauth2_token	Revokes a users refresh token and removes all their connections to your app	N/A	empty OAuth2 token
api_client.refresh_oauth2_token	Refreshes OAuth2 token set	N/A	new token set
api_client.set_oauth2_token	Sets OAuth2 token directly on the client	dict token: standard token dictionary	N/A
api_client.get_oauth2_token	Get OAuth2 token dictionary	N/A	dict

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
